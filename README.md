## Jupyter Notebook

## DataSet

  ## Label data:
  https://github.com/ravikduvvuri/FashionImagesClassification/blob/main/styles.csv

  ## Images data:
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset/data


## 1. Overview and Business Understanding
For a fashion retailer or manufacturer, identifying and entering product attributes into a system is a tedious job; if we have a model that can classify images and get attributes, it is a great help for them and it can also enhance master product data store with less effort. In this project, my goal is explore various models and create a better model to classify images and update label attributes into a dataframe. To Train and Test the models, I leveraged the fashionProductImages Dataset from Kaggle.

## 2. Data Understanding
To understand the data, I did the following:

  ### 3.1 Initial steps done
    
    3.1.1 Imported relevant libraries and packages
    
    3.1.2 Read 'styles.csv' into a pandas dataframe and Loaded product images into /images folder (Plan to load only few images <500)
    
    3.1.3 Displayed sample data using df.sample(5) to see what features are there in the dataset
    
    3.1.4 Gained some domain knowledge and checked data and possible relationships among them
  
  ### 3.2 Next steps done
  
    3.2.1 Using df.info() found the total features, size of the dataset and data types of features
    
    3.2.2 Checked for 'missing data'
    
    3.2.3 Searched for duplicate data

## 4. Data Preparation

### 4.1 Data cleanup
  Based on data analysis, I did the following:

    4.1.1 Data seems clean, so no extensive pre-processing was done

    4.1.2 No duplicates found
    
    4.1.3 Removed missing data rows as they are not needed for images classification
       
### 4.2 EDA on Styles data
  These plots provide the information about how data looks like from distribution perspective
  
    4.2.1 Colour distribution by Gender
    
    4.2.2 Colour distribution by Master Category

    4.2.3 Colour distribution by usage

### 4.3 EDA on Images data
  These plots provide the information about how data looks like from distribution perspective
  
    4.3.1 Display sample pictures
    
    4.3.2 Colour distribution of a sample image

## 8. Additional Packages for Model training 
    
    8.1.1 OpenCV - Model performance evaluation using OpenCV, HOG, LBP via features extraction
    
    8.1.2 Pillow - Model performance evaluation using Pillow and RandomForest

## 9. Comparision - Actual Label Vs Predicted Label and Plot 
    
    9.1.1 Model performance - Actual Data Vs Predicted Data

**Based on models evaluation, Pillow package prediction is perfect with few or no false positives. It classified images correctly. See the confusion matrix above**

## 10. Next Steps 
    
### 1) Perform model fit on even larger dataset

### 2) Enhance the modelling using CNN, Transfer Learning etc.

### 3) Enhance modelling if we can extract additional features from the images while processing the classification

### 4) Feed a brand new dataset outside of that used for train/test to test the accuracy of model
